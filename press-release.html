						</div>
						<p>The S911 Enforcer is a wearable Law Enforcement Bracelet used for house arrest and restraining order applications, constructed with Laipac’s award-winning GPS technologies. The S911 Enforcer uses a powerful Cortex processor with high sensitivity GNSS (GPS & GLONASS) receiver. This innovated security wearable device is equipped with programable geofences which instantly notifies the supervisor with alerts when the holder of the S911 Enforcer enters or exits a geofence. The S911 Enforcer is also equipped with a dedicated call button that can directly make two-way calls between the device holder and the designated call recipient. It has a loud-volume sound speaker and a sensitive microphone to ensure that calls and warning messages are heard.</p>
						<p>For installation on a user, the S911 Enforcer has a security stainless-steel lock. Any tampering, unauthorized opening of the lock, or cutting of the wrist band will instantaneously trigger the tamper alert on Laipac’s IoT platform, LocationNow.com. The S911 Enforcer contains the most advanced technology for law enforcement monitoring applications compared to the traditional ankle bracelet. It has a ruggedized case material for maximum strength, durability, and is rated at IP68 for waterproof.</p>

						<p><b>Richmond Hill, Ontario, March 13, 2018:</b> Laipac Technology Inc., a leading company in the development of Internet of Things (IoT) products and solutions, this week announced they will be hosting a LooK Watch Media Conference at their office headquarters located at 20 Mural Street, Unit 5, in Richmond Hill on Thursday, March 15th. The Look Watch is the first Internet of Things (IoT) enabled standalone smartwatch. It combines Laipac’s Guardian Angel Connect feature and LocationNow IoT platform, with the ability to access internet and make two-way calls without being tethered to a smartphone.</p>
						<p>LooK Watch is designed to look elegant and stylish like a classic mechanical watch, it features a large round touch screen, one of the highest resolutions available today, AMOLED Display, silver or 24k Gold Plating, elegant watch faces, and six color combinations. Durable in composition, the LooK Watch is also cold forged in 316L stainless steel, using sapphire glass and a protective bezel. The watch is dust proof, water proof, and carries one of the longest lasting batteries available.</p>
						<p>“We are inviting Toronto media personnel to come to our office this week and demo the LooK Watch for themselves,” said Diego Lai, Co-founder and CEO of Laipac Technology Inc. “Providing an intimate look at our revolutionary watch product, we are excited to share its unique features, attributes, and hand-made designs with everyone in attendance.” Embodying a high quality of digitization, the LooK Watch displays the most apps of any non-iOS watch for users, with a high-quality speaker and incomparable memory storage of 16GB.</p>
						<p>Laipaic recently wrapped up successful show in MWC Barcelona 2018, showcasing the watch to all interested brand advocates at the event.</p>
						<p>More than just an activity tracker, Look Watch’s Guardian Angel Connect gives you the ultimate peace of mind. You can relax knowing you and your loved ones are safe. Laipac has built its reputation on vehicle tracking, asset monitoring and mobile healthcare devices since 1999. Laipac’s mPERS (mobile Personal Emergency Response Service) technology has been used to protect field workers, law enforcement agents, professionals, families and business executives in over 100 countries. Look Watch connects to LocationNow.com thru Guardian Angel Connect feature; where at any given time, the user can freely enable or disable the Guardian Angel Connect on the LooK Watch. In case of emergency, one second touch on the SOS button will call a pre-set fast dial numbers for voice call to the user's predefined emergency numbers as well as send an SMS, and deliver GPS location data to LocationNow.com.</p>
						<p>Using G-sensors, the Look Watch generates an alert if a fall is detected. If it’s a false alarm, the user will only need to press the SOS button when prompted to do so, and the alert will not be sent. If the user is unable to cancel the alert, it will be sent to the device of your choosing, along with GPS coordinates and address of where the incident occurred. Upon receiving the fall alert, you can communicate directly with the user to give them reassurance that help is on the way.</p>
						<p>Look Watch also acts as an enhanced activity tracker, monitoring heart rate, steps traveled, and even showing the exact route taken. The heart rate monitor is helpful for tracking vitals when the user is ill, after an accident, or at any time. “As a fitness, safety, communication, and all around resourceful smart watch today, we are passionate about sharing our innovation with all those who are interested. We welcome Toronto Medias to visit us,” said Lai.</p>

						<p>TORONTO – May 3, 2017 – <a href="http://www.ryerson.ca/science/">Ryerson University’s Faculty of Science</a> today announces a strategic partnership with Laipac Technology Inc, a leader in the development of GPS and Internet of Things (IoT) products and services. The partnership will support the development of a novel, fast and scalable technique for simulating the behaviour of large crowds in near real-time. Using wearable IoT devices, event organizers will be able to manage dense crowds while also identifying the potential for stampedes and mitigating their impact.</p>
						<p>“Improving quality of life and delivering innovative solutions to protect people are core to our mission,” says Diego Lai, Co-founder and CEO of Laipac Technology Inc. “We hope that through this partnership we can develop an intelligent and reliable system to control, predict and eliminate the possibility of stampedes during large crowd events.” Established in 1999, Laipac Technology has become a market leader in offering reliable and user friendly GPS locator devices.</p>
						<p>Dr. Andriy Miranskyy, a researcher in quantifying and managing risk at Ryerson University says this project will introduce an innovative solution to the crowd management sector and offer new ways of managing its challenges. “We are thrilled to partner with Laipac Technology on this exciting project.”</p>
						<p>The initiative is being funded <a href="http://www.oce-ontario.org/">by Ontario Centres of Excellence (OCE)</a> and the <a href="http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp">Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)</a> as a part of the <a href="http://www.oce-ontario.org/programs/industry-academic-collaboration/collaboration-voucher-program/VIP">Voucher for Innovation and Productivity Program (VIP).</a> The VIP program helps eligible Ontario companies develop, implement and commercialize technical innovations by supporting industry-academic collaborations. Industry can leverage Ontario’s world-class academic institutions to solve business challenges, develop new products and processes, and increase productivity while advancing innovations that help to build and sustain Ontario's knowledge-based economy.</p>
						<p>“We are pleased to support this dynamic partnership and the groundbreaking work Ryerson University and Laipac Technology are doing in the area of crowd management. This is the kind of breakthrough that can prevent tragedies and create safer environments for large groups of people to gather,” says Dr. Tom Corr, OCE’s President and CEO.</p>
						<p>The project will be unique in providing wearable IoT devices to event organizers. Through the software developed, event organizers will be able to identify locations of people wearing trackers compatible with the software and, by predicting their movements, proactively detect probable catastrophic events. By communicating with event attendees and issuing warning messages sent through wearable devices, authorities will be able to guide peoples’ movements and prevent accidents.</p>
						<p>Speaking on behalf of NSERC - the federal government’s principal funding agency for scientific and engineering research conducted at Canada’s universities and colleges, Dr. Andrew Sinclair, Manager, NSERC Ontario Regional Office, said: “This project represents one the latest examples of the ‘VIP1-Engage’ co-funding opportunity that NSERC and OCE launched as an innovative federal-provincial collaboration in 2013.  VIP1-Engage makes it possible for researchers to access combined federal and provincial funding by way of a convenient single application. Co-funding by the two levels of government permits researchers to conduct projects with twice the resources that would normally be possible.  The result is projects with broader reach and enhanced innovation impact.”</p>
